jtHardcore is a simple Bukkit Minecraft plugin that essentially acts as a "deathban" plugin. When a player dies they are automatically banned from the server with two lightning strikes (won't harm other players) striking their location. An alert is also sent to the console to log the death as well as a RIP message sent to players. Optional permission node "jthardcore.protect" to stop player from being automatically banned when killed (useful for operators).
